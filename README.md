## Setup

### Open the Chrome Extensions page:

1.  Open Google Chrome.
2.  Navigate to chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" at the top-right corner of the page.

### Load the extension:

1.  Click the "Load unpacked" button, which appears after you enable Developer mode.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository.
3.  Select the folder of the plugin and click "Open".

The "Short Killer" extension should now be added to your Chrome browser and active. It will automatically redirect YouTube Shorts URLs to their equivalent standard video URLs whenever you encounter them on YouTube.

## Limitations

Due to the reliance on periodic checks and not having a deep integration with YouTube's dynamically loading content and navigation mechanisms, this extension may occasionally miss redirecting some Shorts links on first load or during rapid navigation.
